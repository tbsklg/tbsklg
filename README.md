<h1>Tobias Klug</h2>
<p>I am a full-stack developer, and I am currently working at codecentric.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about functional programming and functional software architecture.</p>
<p> I love to constantly challenge myself by working with Katas (mainly from Codewars and Exercism) and exploring new languages</p>
<p>When I'm not programming, you can probably find me 🧗‍♂️ or 🚵.</p>
